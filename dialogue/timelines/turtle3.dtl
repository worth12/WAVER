fox: [color=#A8A8A8](joking)[/color] Howdy, Shelly. Did you convince that Casanova of yours to drop off his baggage yet?

turtle: [color=#A8A8A8](nodding happily)[/color] He finally gave in, {player.name}. He promised me he will leave his wife.

- He's married?!
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](shocked)[/color] What? Wife? He's a married man?
- ???
 	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](stunned)[/color] ???

turtle: [color=#A8A8A8](smiling and showing off a ring on her finger)[/color] He got me this and all. We going to start a family together, {player.name}.

fox: [color=#A8A8A8](mumbling)[/color] I don't know about this, Shelly. This isn't right.

turtle: [color=#A8A8A8](amused)[/color] Who cares, life is short. Happiness is something people are willing to die for, no? See you soon, {player.name}. I will be a married woman the next time you see me.
