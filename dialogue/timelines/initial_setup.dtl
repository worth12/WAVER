Another day begins at your small-town coffee shop. You've only been running it for a few months, but you've already gotten to know your regular customers quite well.

There's Mittens, a corporate cat who takes her coffee temperature extremely seriously - right down to the exact degree.

Then there's Betty, a kind-hearted cow who supplies the shop's milk. Though lately, something about her business seems... concerning.

Bonnie, a rabbit who's always chatting about her large family. She's been having some marriage troubles lately.

And Shelly, a young turtle who recently started visiting. She seems sweet, if perhaps a bit naive.

fox: [color=#A8A8A8](to self)[/color] Time to open up shop. These drinks won't make themselves!

As a barista, you'll need to master three key skills:

- Creating the right foam consistency
- Making beautiful latte art
