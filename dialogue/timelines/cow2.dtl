fox: [color=#A8A8A8](wiping down the counter, cautiously)[/color] Hey, Betty. Got a minute?
cow: [color=#A8A8A8](setting her teacup down)[/color] Always for you, sweetpea. What's rattlin' around in that head of yours?
fox: [color=#A8A8A8](hesitant)[/color] I was reading something earlier—about farms, you know, using laborers in tough spots. It got me wondering… how does your milk business work?
cow: [color=#A8A8A8](with a soft smile)[/color] Oh, sugar, you've got a curious mind, don't you? My girls come to me when they're in a pinch—some debt, some hard times—and I give 'em a hand up. A roof, good food, and honest work.

- They can leave, right?
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](concerned)[/color] But they're free to leave if they want to, right?
- That sounds… helpful…
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](neutral)[/color] That sounds… helpful, I guess.

cow: Well, they've got debts to work off, darlin'. But I make sure they're treated fair. Better than what some others would do, that's for sure.

- What happens if they can't pay it off?
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](pressing)[/color] What happens if they can't pay it off? Do they get stuck?
- As long as they're treated well
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](reluctant to push)[/color] As long as they're treated well, that's something.

cow: [color=#A8A8A8](leaning in slightly)[/color] Fox, you've got a good heart, but you've gotta understand—life ain't always kind. I give 'em a chance when no one else will. That counts for somethin', don't it?

- There's a better way
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](gently)[/color] It does, but I can't help feeling like there's a better way.
- I don't know
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](thoughtfully)[/color] I guess I don't know what I'd do in your shoes.

cow: [color=#A8A8A8](smiling softly)[/color] Well, darlin', let's hope you never have to find out.
fox: I hope not, Betty.
cow: [color=#A8A8A8](standing up and grabbing her purse)[/color] Alright, I've kept you long enough. Take care, Fox. You're a good kid—don't let the world get to ya too much.
[color=#A8A8A8](She heads toward the door.)[/color]
fox: See you tomorrow, Betty.
[color=#A8A8A8](She exits, the door chimes softly as it closes behind her.)[/color]
