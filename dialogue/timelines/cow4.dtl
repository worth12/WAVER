cow: Fox, darlin', somethin's eatin' at you. What's the matter?
fox: [color=#A8A8A8](hesitant)[/color] Betty, I've been thinking about your milkâ€¦ and the workers behind it.
cow: [color=#A8A8A8](frowning slightly)[/color] What about 'em? You got somethin' to say, sugar, just come on out with it.

- Doesn't feel right
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](carefully)[/color] I just don't know if I feel right about it anymore.
- Stop using it
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](bluntly)[/color] I don't think I can keep using it, Betty.

cow: [color=#A8A8A8](taken aback)[/color] You'd stop buyin' from me? After all I've done for this place? You know I've got mouths to feed too, Fox.

- Not about you
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](gently)[/color] It's not about you, Betty. It's about what feels right.
- Can't ignore
	fox: [color=#A8A8A8](resolute)[/color] I'm sorry, but I can't ignore this anymore.

cow: [color=#A8A8A8](after a long pause, her voice softer)[/color] Well, darlin', I'll think on what you've said. That's all I can promise.
[color=#A8A8A8](She stands up and puts on her coat)[/color]
cow: You take care of yourself, Fox. I'll be back for that milk next week. Maybe we'll talk more then.
fox: [color=#A8A8A8](nodding)[/color] I hope you do, Betty. Take care.
[color=#A8A8A8](Betty heads out the door, leaving Fox to contemplate the weight of their conversation.)[/color]
